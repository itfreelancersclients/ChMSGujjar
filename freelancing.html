    <p class="tagline">Professional Freelancers for Global Businesses</p>

    <h2>What is Freelancing?</h2>
    <p>
      Freelancing is one of the fastest-growing ways to earn money online in today’s digital world.
      It allows individuals to work independently, offer services globally, and earn income without
      being tied to a traditional 9-to-5 job. Freelancers provide their skills to clients on a project
      or contract basis, giving them flexibility, freedom, and control over their careers.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Freelancing is Growing Worldwide</h2>
    <p>
      With the rise of remote work, freelancing has become extremely popular in countries like USA,
      UK, Australia, Canada, and Europe, where businesses prefer skilled remote professionals
      to reduce costs and increase productivity.
